<h4>My latest travel exprerience:</h4>
<p>Before I came to the US, I went to Thailand. It was such a great advanture because I knew nothing about it before I went there alone and I didn't informed anybody except my closet friends. I would never regret my decision because Thailand treated me well with cool places, nice people and dilicious foods. </p>
<h4>My hobbies:</h4>
<p>I love singing and cooking. And tennis is always my favorite sport. I haven't practiced for a long time but I started to pick it up recently.</p>
